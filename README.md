# :video_game: Shift Wizard
<em>Travel the board while absorbing elemental powers.   
Cast spells to manipulate your path to the ultimate power crystal!</em> :gem:

## This game was created during my very first GameJam - GM48   
It has been a dream in the making to participate in a Game Building Competition - putting my programming skills to the test!  
This game was coded in GameMaker during the GM48 competition under the theme: Spell Casting.

## Challenges:
- Learning the GameMaker editor and becoming familiar with the documentation
- Coming up with solutions to game mechanics that I haven't seen explained in a tutorial
- Breaking problems into smaller and isolated components to better address a solution
- Working through the grind! I coded for 32.5hrs of the 48hrs available  
  
<em>The original submission was unfinished, lacked sound effects and was quite buggy    
BUT I succeeded in submitting a solo-coded, playable version of the game that I feel represents my vision.</em>

All of the beautiful pixel art was completed by Haydn - Thank you!!ðŸ”¥  
The less skilled pixel art was completed by me as placeholders that haven't been replaced yet. :expressionless:
